# Payment Method Posting Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the posting flow for both tasks and services to include payment method selection. Users can now specify how they want to pay (for tasks) or receive payment (for services) using GCash, PayMaya, or GoTyme.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Payment Method Selection
- **Three payment options**: GCash, PayMaya, and GoTyme
- **Context-aware labels**: 
  - Tasks: "How do you want to pay?"
  - Services: "How do you want to receive payment?"
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded badges with emojis for each payment method
- **Default selection**: GCash is pre-selected by default

### 2. Enhanced Form Schema
- **New field**: `paymentMethod` added to the form validation schema
- **Required field**: Payment method selection is mandatory
- **Type safety**: Proper TypeScript types for payment methods

### 3. Updated Database Schema
- **Task interface**: Added `paymentMethod` field to the Task type
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing tasks without payment method will still work
- **Data consistency**: All new posts will include payment method information

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- **Payment method badges**: Displayed on task cards with color-coded emojis
- **Professional UI**: Clean, intuitive payment method selection interface
- **Responsive design**: Works well on all device sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Form Schema Updates
```typescript
// Enhanced form schema with payment method
export function createEnhancedFormSchema() {
  return z.object({
    // ... existing fields
    paymentMethod: z.enum(["gcash", "paymaya", "gotyme"], {
      required_error: "Please select a payment method.",
    }),
  });
}
```

### Task Interface Updates
```typescript
export interface Task {
  // ... existing fields
  paymentMethod: 'gcash' | 'paymaya' | 'gotyme';
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Component Updates
- **PostingWizard**: Added payment method selection to Step 3
- **PostPage**: Added payment method field to main posting form
- **TaskCard**: Added payment method badge display

## User Experience Improvements
