# Verification Gate Implementation

## Overview

The verification gate system prevents unverified users from viewing full task/service posts while still allowing them to see previews. This encourages users to complete their verification process.

## Components

### VerificationGate Component (`src/components/verification-gate.tsx`)

A reusable component that:
- Shows a preview/redacted version of content for unverified users
- Displays a verification prompt overlay
- Integrates with the verification modal
- Handles loading states and pending verification status

**Props:**
- `children`: The full content to show for verified users
- `previewContent`: Optional preview content to show for unverified users
- `title`: Custom title for the verification prompt
- `description`: Custom description for the verification prompt
- `showVerificationModal`: Whether to show the verification modal (default: true)
- `onVerificationComplete`: Callback when verification is completed

## Implementation Details

### Task Cards (`src/components/task-card.tsx`)

- Wrapped with `VerificationGate` component
- Shows preview content for unverified users with disabled "Verification Required" button
- Shows full content with working "View" button for verified users
- Preview content is identical to full content but with reduced opacity and disabled interactions

### Post Detail Pages (`src/app/post/[id]/page.tsx`)

- Wrapped with `VerificationGate` component
- Shows limited preview (title, category, location, price) for unverified users
- Shows full details (description, author info, action buttons) for verified users
- Preview content shows a placeholder message instead of full details

### User Experience

**For Unverified Users:**
1. See task cards with reduced opacity and "Verification Required" button
2. Cannot click through to view full post details
3. See limited preview on post detail pages
4. Get prompted to complete verification with modal or status page link

**For Verified Users:**
1. See normal task cards with working "View" buttons
2. Can access full post details without restrictions
3. All functionality works as expected

**For Users with Pending Verification:**
1. See "Verification Pending" status
2. Get link to check verification status
3. Cannot access full content until verification is complete

## Integration Points

### Verification Status Hook (`src/hooks/use-verification-status.tsx`)

The verification gate uses the existing verification status hook to:
- Check if user is fully verified (both selfie and ID document verified)
- Check if verification is pending
- Handle loading states

### Verification Modal (`src/components/verification-modal.tsx`)

Integrated to allow users to complete verification directly from the gate.

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Prevents unverified users from accessing sensitive information
2. **User Engagement**: Encourages verification completion
3. **Transparency**: Users can still see what content is available
4. **Consistency**: Applied across all post viewing contexts
5. **User-Friendly**: Clear messaging and easy verification process

## Future Enhancements

- Add analytics to track verification conversion rates
- Implement progressive disclosure (show more content as verification progresses)
- Add verification status badges to user profiles
- Consider different verification levels for different content types
