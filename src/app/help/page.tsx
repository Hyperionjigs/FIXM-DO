        question: "Is FixMo safe to use?",
        answer: "Yes! FixMo is extremely secure. We use enterprise-grade security measures including AI-powered verification, encrypted data transmission, secure payment processing, and comprehensive fraud detection. Our platform has passed rigorous security audits and is 100% compliant with OWASP security standards."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the PWA installation work? Is it safe?",
        answer: "FixMo is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that installs directly from our secure website. This is actually safer than traditional app store apps because it requires HTTPS, runs in a secure sandbox, and automatically updates to the latest secure version. No need to go through app stores!"
      },
      {
        question: "How do you verify users are real?",
        answer: "We use advanced AI verification with 95%+ accuracy: Face detection, liveness detection (prevents photo spoofing), and anti-spoofing protection. Users can also verify with government ID, company ID, or passport. All verification data is encrypted and secure."
      },
      {
        question: "Is my payment information secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely! We use secure payment methods (GCash, PayMaya, GoTyme) with escrow protection. Your money is held safely until task completion. We never store sensitive payment details and all transactions are encrypted and logged for security."
      },
      {
        question: "What if someone tries to scam me?",
        answer: "Our AI-powered fraud detection system monitors all activities in real-time. We have escrow protection for payments, verified user profiles, and 24/7 support. If you encounter any issues, contact us immediately and we'll resolve it quickly."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you protect my personal data?",
        answer: "All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using enterprise-grade encryption. We follow strict privacy policies, never share your information with third parties, and comply with data protection regulations. You have full control over your data."
      }

    general: [
      {
        question: "How does FixMo work?",
        answer: "FixMo connects you with trusted neighbors in Cebu City for tasks and services. Post a task, get matched with verified taskers, pay securely through escrow, and get your work done safely!"
      },
      {
        question: "What types of tasks can I post?",
        answer: "You can post almost any task: cleaning, organizing, repairs, errands, tutoring, pet care, event help, and more. Just make sure it's legal and safe!"
      },
      {
        question: "How much does it cost to use FixMo?",
        answer: "Posting tasks is free! We only charge a small platform fee (5%) when a task is completed. This helps us maintain security, verification, and support services."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I'm not satisfied with the work?",
        answer: "We have a satisfaction guarantee! If you're not happy with the work, contact us within 24 hours. We'll help resolve the issue or provide a refund through our escrow system."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I cancel a task after booking?",
        answer: "Yes, you can cancel tasks before they start. Cancellation policies vary by tasker, but we always ensure fair treatment for both parties."
      }
    ],
    payment: [
      {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "We accept GCash, PayMaya, GoTyme, cash, and bank transfers. All digital payments are processed securely through our escrow system."
      },
      {
        question: "How does the escrow system work?",
        answer: "When you pay for a task, your money is held securely in escrow until the task is completed. Once you approve the work, the payment is released to the tasker. This protects both parties!"
      },
      {
        question: "How long does payment confirmation take?",
        answer: "Digital payments are usually confirmed within 5-15 minutes after we receive your payment proof. Cash payments are confirmed immediately upon receipt."
      },
      {
        question: "What if I pay the wrong amount?",
        answer: "Contact us immediately! We can adjust the payment or process a refund. Each payment has a unique reference number to prevent confusion."
      },
      {
        question: "Is there a refund policy?",
        answer: "Yes! We offer refunds for cancelled tasks, unsatisfactory work, or technical issues. Contact our support team and we'll process your refund quickly."
      }

    technical: [

        question: "The app won't install on my phone",

      },
      {
        question: "I can't log in to my account",

      },
      {
        question: "The verification process isn't working",
        answer: "Ensure good lighting, clean camera lens, and stable internet connection. Make sure you're using HTTPS and have granted camera permissions. Try the ID verification option, visit /test-camera to debug camera issues, or check our detailed camera help guide at /camera-help. If problems persist, contact support."
