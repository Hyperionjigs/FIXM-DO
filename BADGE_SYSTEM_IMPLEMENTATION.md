# FixMo Badge System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive badge system for FixMo that replaces the placeholder verification badges with a full gamification system. The system features **16 badges** across **5 levels** with proper progression from egg (unverified) to chick (verified) and beyond.

## 🏆 Badge System Architecture

### **Level Progression**
1. **🥚 Unverified** - Starting point for new users
2. **🐤 Starter** - Basic verification and first steps
3. **⭐ Mid** - Building reputation and skills
4. **🚀 Advanced** - Expert level achievements
5. **👑 Prestigious** - Legendary status

### **Badge Categories**
- **Verification Badges** - Profile and photo verification
- **Task Badges** - Task completion milestones
- **Reputation Badges** - Rating and review achievements
- **Community Badges** - Mentorship and leadership
- **Achievement Badges** - Special accomplishments

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Badge Icons & Colors**
- **🥚 Unverified**: Gray theme with lock icon
- **🐤 Verified**: Green theme with chick icon
- **⭐ Skilled Helper**: Yellow theme with star icon (as requested)
